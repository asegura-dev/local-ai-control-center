## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Initial project scaffold: installable package skeleton, packaging
  configuration, and quality gate tooling (linter, type checker, test runner).
- A smoke test that verifies the package imports and exposes a version.
- Documentation as a short book of numbered chapters: overview, architecture,
  roadmap, and development.
- MIT license.
- ADR-based documentation system: a book of numbered chapters plus decision
  records (`docs/adr/`), an index, and the guiding principle that every document
  is written from a real decision.
- Core configuration (`config`): a validated, frozen Pydantic contract
  (`network_access` off by default, `audit_level`, `workspace_root`) loadable
  from YAML, validated at the boundary.
- Run identity (`run`): a human-readable, time-ordered, unique `run_id` for each
  execution.
- Runtime dependencies: pydantic and pyyaml.
