# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Profiler (`profiler`) and the `lacc profile` command: detects and reports what the
  machine offers - whether Ollama is present, which models are installed (with size
  and quantization), and hardware facts (architecture, processor, OS, CPU count,
  total memory, free disk, uptime). Reads and reports only; it never pulls a model
  or runs inference.
- A rough model-fit table computed by formula (weight is parameters times bit-width
  over eight) across common sizes and quantizations, marked fits / tight / too large,
  presented as an approximation to verify rather than a recommendation.
- Honest notes instead of guesses: that capacity assumes free memory, that exceeding
  it causes slow swapping, how to check free memory in real time, and that GPU/NPU
  accelerators may exist but be unusable (Ollama runs on CPU on Snapdragon).

### Dependencies
- Added psutil, used only to read total memory and boot time portably.


## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Permissions granted to a skill now come from what the skill declares, limited by
  the configuration ceiling (`grant_for`), replacing the hardcoded `read_files`
  the CLI used as a stopgap. A skill receives exactly the capabilities it declares,
  minus any the configuration forbids - nothing more, nothing vetoed.


## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Command-line interface (`cli`): the `lacc` command, built with Typer and
  rendered with Rich, both confined to the CLI so the core stays free of interface
  code.
- `lacc run <skill> <request>` plans a skill, shows the preview, asks for
  confirmation (defaulting to no), and on an explicit yes executes and records it.
- `lacc preview <skill> <request>` shows what would happen without asking,
  executing, or recording.
- The `lacc` console script now points at the real CLI entry point, replacing the
  scaffold placeholder.

### Dependencies
- Added typer and rich, confined to the command-line interface.


## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Skills (`skill`): an abstract `Skill` contract mirroring the provider port. A
  skill declares its name and required capabilities and implements `plan`, which
  turns a request into an action and a prompt without side effects.
- `SummarizeFileSkill`: the first demonstration skill, read-only. It declares a
  `read_files` requirement and a target path inside the workspace, exercising the
  permission check and the boundary end to end.
- `run_skill`: wires a skill to the execution cycle, so a skill is always run
  through preview, permission check, confirmation, execution, and audit - never on
  its own.


## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Execution cycle (`cycle`): `run_action` drives an action through the whole
  system in order - preview, refuse or ask, execute, record - so callers describe
  what they want done without knowing how a run proceeds.
- Human confirmation is supplied as a function, not performed by the core, so the
  cycle works from a terminal, a test, or any future interface without containing
  interface code.
- Refused and declined runs are recorded, not just completed ones: the audit trail
  can answer whether something was ever attempted. New audit events `run_refused`
  and `confirmation_declined`.
- The first integration tests, exercising configuration, workspace, permissions,
  provider, preview, and audit together rather than in isolation.
- Continuous integration: the quality gate runs on every push via GitHub Actions.
- An example configuration file (`config.example.yaml`) with each option's
  consequence documented.


## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Execution preview (`preview`): describes what an action would do before it runs
  and whether it would be allowed, with no side effects - nothing is written, no
  provider is called.
- `IntendedAction`: a generic description (name, summary, required capabilities,
  target paths) that anything can produce, so the preview does not depend on skills.
- Previews report every refusal reason at once - missing capabilities and paths
  escaping the workspace boundary - and render a readable block for confirmation.


## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Audit log (`audit`): append-only JSON Lines records written inside the workspace,
  with the path resolved through the workspace boundary. Each event carries a UTC
  timestamp, the `run_id`, a closed-set event kind, a message, and optional detail.
- `audit_level` gains behavior: `standard` (the default) records metadata only,
  omitting prompt and completion content; `full` records content as an explicit
  opt-in.
- `audit_failure_policy` in the configuration: `abort` (the default) refuses to
  proceed when a record cannot be written; `continue` proceeds unrecorded. Each
  option documents its consequence.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Provider port (`provider`): an abstract `Provider` with a single operation
  (prompt in, `Completion` out) so the core never depends on a concrete engine.
  Completions carry the name of the provider that produced them, so results can be
  attributed in an audit record.
- `MockProvider`: a deterministic implementation that touches no network, model, or
  filesystem. Answers from caller-supplied scripted responses, or falls back to a
  predictable response derived from the prompt. Makes every later phase testable
  offline.


## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Permissions (`permissions`): a frozen contract with one capability per field
  (`read_files`, `write_files`, `network`, `run_commands`), all disabled by default
  so an empty `Permissions()` grants nothing.
- Configuration as a ceiling: `effective_permissions` intersects granted
  capabilities with what the configuration allows, so a capability the
  configuration forbids cannot be granted by a skill.
- `check` returns a `PermissionCheck` naming exactly which capabilities are
  missing, for execution previews; `require` raises `PermissionDenied` on the
  execution path.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Workspaces (`workspace`): a validated, frozen contract around a root directory
  with an enforced boundary. `is_within` and `resolve_within` resolve `..` and
  symlinks before checking, so paths cannot escape the workspace. Root creation is
  explicit via `ensure`, never a silent side effect of construction.
- `workspace_from_config`: builds an operational workspace from a configuration's
  `workspace_root`, the seam connecting config to workspace.


## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Initial project scaffold: installable package skeleton, packaging
  configuration, and quality gate tooling (linter, type checker, test runner).
- A smoke test that verifies the package imports and exposes a version.
- Documentation as a short book of numbered chapters: overview, architecture,
  roadmap, and development.
- MIT license.
- ADR-based documentation system: a book of numbered chapters plus decision
  records (`docs/adr/`), an index, and the guiding principle that every document
  is written from a real decision.
- Core configuration (`config`): a validated, frozen Pydantic contract
  (`network_access` off by default, `audit_level`, `workspace_root`) loadable
  from YAML, validated at the boundary.
- Run identity (`run`): a human-readable, time-ordered, unique `run_id` for each
  execution.
- Runtime dependencies: pydantic and pyyaml.
